      <h2>ENGL 3844 was interesting...</h2>
      <p id="p1">
        All of the work for this course has culminated to this project;
        the creation of my Data Story did not just take three-ish weeks
        in a semester, but an entire semester to learn and adapt to technical
        writing. This course was not what I expected in the slightest, however
        I’m glad to have the experience from ENGL 3844.

          <h3>Data Collection</h3>
          <p>
            My Data Collection was a very large feet- I took on my online messaging habits. Between texts and Snapchats I emmased around 80 points in a single day and over 400 points from Monday to Friday. With this, I looked at my emotional response to messages, how often I ignored messages, who was receiving the most responses throughout the day and how long it took me to respond. I found out a lot of things with my data; I respond to text messages faster than a Snapchat and more often than not, I will ignore friends/acquaintances for hours and respond to family/close friends almost immediately. The week was frustrating because of the sheer mass of data I was tending to but I felt that this project not only expanded my knowledge of spreadsheets, but of myself and what I value most as well. After this week, I took a long break from my phone and really stepped back from my screen.
          </p>
          <h4>Data Types</h4>
            <p>
              There were five types of data that we learned about at the begining of this class: Categorical- Comparing categories and distributions of quantitative values;
              Hierarchical- Charting part-to-whole relationships and hierarchies;
              Relational- Graphing relationships to explore correlations and connections;
              Temporal- Showing trends and activities over time and
              Spatial- Mapping spatial patterns through overlays and distortions.
              The visualization of data paints a clearer picture of the data; while a list may show the numerical and hard facts, the visualization can put the actual size of the data into perspective.

              Based on my data, I a temporal chart was my first thought as the best chart because the main emphasis of my data has been on when I respond to text messages and how long it takes to respond to the message. It could also have elements of a relational chart to show the correlation between how long it took me to respond to a certain person.
            </p>
          <h4>Sorting my Data</h4>
            <p>
              After going through and collecting an abundant ammount of data, I decided to cut it down and make my visualization based on four of the points: who I responded to, what app I responded to them on, how long the response took and what emotion I felt.

          <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
          <p>
            The creation of my Data Visualization started off a bit rocky; Inkscape was such a bad program that I jumped ship and learned Adobe Illustrator. This served me better for the future and in my major but I had a lot of fun creating this graphic. My initial idea was to create something visually clean but easy to understand, with over 400 points that was the biggest priority. I drew out a very rough sketch on paper and from there, bringing it to life was simple. Over the course of three days, I mapped and plotted all of my data, mostly using the line tool to create this vector image.

            Each curved, horizontal line around circle represents an individual and every message I received from them throughout the day was represented by a vertical line. The longer the vertical line, the longer it took to respond to their message. At the base of the line is a colored dot representing what app the message came from (green=Text yellow=Snapchat). The colored dot at the end of the line represents which emotion was felt after the message.

          <h3>Explained Video</h3>
          <p>
            The Explained Video project was fun because it not only opened up dialog on something I had never talked about, but fostered collaboration with other students! Being a journalism major, I’ve had prior experience using Adobe Premiere and enjoy making videos. We collected a lot of information on content moderation and it was super cool to learn about the back end of social media production. I enjoyed learning about different types of cuts for videos and was really happy with how it turned out.
          </p>
          <h4>Why Content Moderation?</h4>
          <p>
            While it must be done, content moderation is a taxing and grueling job for the people who are required to not only find the explicit content, but watch and remove it as well. A former moderator is suing Facebook for damages and PTSD caused by her job. I think as people who regularly use social media (as it is integrated into our daily lives) we don’t often think of what happens behind the scenes: people put their mental health on the line to keep others from being scared. This issue is very important because there are potentially better ways of going about this, such as configuring an algorithm to remove said content. With the detailed rules and regulations listed by companies, creating an algorithm to adhere to them shouldn’t be too difficult.
          </p>
          <h4>Using Premiere</h4>
          <p>
            I taught my group members some tricks and tips for Premiere; how to include images, overlay text on top of a screen and I showed them different ways of taking shots with my DSLR camera. We used different screen recording apps to capture some of our clips and used our phones to capture audio.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was the most enjoyable by far because it has allowed to me to not only expand my knowledge of video editing but also push my creativity on an interesting topic. Our group worked very well together and collaborated outside of class multiple times to make this video work out. It ended up longer than it was supposed to be, however in order to shine a light on this topic the way it deserves it was absolutely necessary.
